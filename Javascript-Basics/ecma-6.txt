// ECMA 6

- Arrow functions, enhanced collections, generators
- ES6 code feels very clean, intuitive and well designed
- Babel and Webpack help create an ES6 development environment

Why do we need Babel Transpiler?

What is a transpiler?
- reads code written in one language and produces the equivalent code in another
ex. typescript, coffee-script

- Browsers only currently have widespread support of older JS.
- Transpilers convert advanced TypeScript and CoffeeScript code back into original JS.

Babel (for es6)
Transpiles es6 back into supported pre-es6 JS.

babeljs.io
